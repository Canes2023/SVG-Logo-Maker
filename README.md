# SVG-Logo-Maker

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a SVG logo maker that generates logos after answering all questions from the console. My logo generator does exactly that. You type the command "node generateLogo.js" without quotes in the terminal and it runs the script. All you have to do is answer all questions and the logo is generated. It will tell you the location of where the logo was generated at and there you can view your logo. 

Code was made by me and I also had help from my Professor and TA. They helped me fix the bugs and redesign some of the code to get it working. It's still a little quirky and may have some bugs still. It was quite difficult getting it to work. I had to uninstall some libraries and reinstall them to fix some issues in the terminal that I was getting.
